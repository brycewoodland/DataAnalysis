## Overview

**Project Title**: 
Bear Attacks in North America Data Analysis

**Project Description**: 
I implemented two Python packages: pandas and matplotlib to 
examine and answer questions about a dataset I found on
Kaggle.com entitled "Bear Attacks in North America". The two questions
I focused on was: What age group was most impacted by bear attacks?, 
What bear type is involved in most attacks?

**Project Goals**:
- Analyze the distribution of ages among bear attack victims.
- Determine which bear type is responsible for the most attacks.
- Understand the variability in the number of attacks per year for each bear type.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python and Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new project and test environment by doing 'Hello World!'.
3. pip install pandas
4. pip install matplotlib

Instructions for using the software:

1. Download the dataset "Bear Attacks in North America" from Kaggle.com
2. Place the dataset in the project directory.
3. Run the code

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python
* Visual Studio Code
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to seek out more statistical analysis skills that I can implement to understand these questions more fully.
* [ ] I want to continue answering other questions that I find from this dataset.
* [ ] I want to develop better data analysis skills that would benefit my understanding better.
